\section{Introduction}

This memo documents the procedure for using the monitoring and control system (MCS) to conduct observations with an LWA station.  This includes the procedure for designing observations, as well as the process for working with MCS to schedule and conduct the observation.  This memo also serves to document the content and format of observation ``metadata''; that is, data which is produced by MCS as part of the processes of scheduling and conducting the observation.  Metadata is distinct from the primary instrument output, which is captured by MCS data recorders (MCS-DRs).  The latter is documented in the ICDs of the NDP and MCS-DR subsystems ({[1]} and {[2]}, respectively).
