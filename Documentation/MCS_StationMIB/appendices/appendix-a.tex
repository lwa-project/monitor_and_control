\section{Example of a Station Static MIB Initialization File}

The following is an example of a Station Static MIB Initialization File for a small station with 16~stands.
It is based on a subset of the LWA1 SSMIF and illustrates the use of default values.
Where defaults are sufficient (e.g., antenna-to-stand mapping, orientations, cable parameters), only comments indicating the use of defaults are shown rather than enumerating every value.
